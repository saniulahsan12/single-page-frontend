Notes:
--------------------------------------------

1. Used google api fonts so internet connection is required i think.

2. Used open sans and nunito as asked, but i think the design layout fonts are little bit different.

3. Tried to make the layout as in image provided but i have also tried the other i devices to look the design better.

4. All tested i have used on emulator as i have no i devices.

5. There was no hover effect suggestions or any animation suggestions. So i have used all on my own.

6. used localhost for the testing, not directly into the link. There are fonts that are from cdn so they may not work.

7. Thanks

Useful Commands:
------------------------------------------

1.open terminal in root directory, and type "npm install". for downloading the necessary packages.(though some local machine needs gulp globally i think on your pc it is already installed. Although i have gulp in package.json)

2. On terminal type "gulp compile-sass" for compiling the sass file, Or you can directly type "gulp build-project" for building the project. You can directly build it though.

3. There should be a build directory created. type "cd build" and insert into it.

4. run localserver on your own. example: 

For PHP: php -S localhost:8000

For Python: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Or you can directly target the folder to wampp/xampp/mamp
